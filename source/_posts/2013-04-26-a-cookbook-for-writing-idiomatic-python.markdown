![Writing Idiomatic Python for Python 2.7.3](/images/wipbook.jpg)

Recently I stumbled upon the book [Writing Idiomatic Python](http://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook/) by [Jeff Knupp](http://www.jeffknupp.com/), and I wanted to grab a copy of it. It wasn't something I could pay for, so I emailed Jeff asking him if he could give me a free copy, and he was kind enough to agree. Well, I just finished the book and I really loved it !

The book is short and sweet and conveys powerful idioms in a clear and concise way. I have read quite a lot about what is good and bad in Python and how to write good code in it, and yet I was able to learn some new things out of this book. That being said, if you don't know the basics of Python, then this is not the book for you.

Well, I'm glad that I'm subscribed to the updates of this book. Oh yea, and whether you're a fanboy or an expert at Python, you've gotta read this book atleast once.

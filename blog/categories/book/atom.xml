    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/wipbook.jpg" alt="Writing Idiomatic Python for Python 2.7.3" /></p>

<p>Recently I stumbled upon the book <a href="http://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook/">Writing Idiomatic Python</a> by <a href="http://www.jeffknupp.com/">Jeff Knupp</a>, and I wanted to grab a copy of it. It wasn't something I could pay for, so I emailed Jeff asking him if he could give me a free copy, and he was kind enough to agree. Well, I just finished the book and I really loved it !</p>

<p>The book is short and sweet and conveys powerful idioms in a clear and concise way. I have read quite a lot about what is good and bad in Python and how to write good code in it, and yet I was able to learn some new things out of this book. That being said, if you don't know the basics of Python, then this is not the book for you.</p>

<p>Well, I'm glad that I'm subscribed to the updates of this book. Oh yea, and whether you're a fanboy or an expert at Python, you've gotta read this book atleast once.</p>
